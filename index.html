				  	<h2>ART</h2>
				  	<p>Art is a field that can take many forms, be it painting, sculpture, drawing, photography or architecture. Visiting museums and art galleries is an experience that is inspiring and fascinating to me. It also gives me a greater appreciation for different cultures and offers me new perspectives on the world around me.

				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>Music can transcend language and cultural barriers, connecting people around the world. Listening to music is a powerful emotional experience for me, as it evokes memories, feelings and emotions. I also play the piano, which keeps me disciplined while relaxing. Also, knowing what music my loved ones listen to allows me to understand them better.

				  	<h2>Fashion</h2>
				  	<p> Fashion offers a unique form of self-expression, as we can dress in such a way that reflects our personality in our outfits. It is also very interesting to follow the new trends, as well as to learn about fashion shows or events in this field, which make me discover new designers for example. I also think it can help people feel better about themselves.

				  	<h2>Diving</h2>
				  	<p>Diving offers me a unique experience to explore the underwater world. This fascinating universe is full of colors, shapes and really amazing creatures. To do this, I have taken a training course, allowing me to dive every time I go to the sea. This allows me to feel in harmony with the aquatic environment.
